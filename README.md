#### Formulae Used:
        Bonus = Salary × Rating-Based % 

        Total Compensation = Salary + Bonus

## To analyze the attached visuals, let’s break down each chart or component systematically:

### 1. Location by Department (Bar Chart - Top Left)
This chart shows how many employees are located in different departments:
#### Key Insights:
- Highest Locations: Departments like "Product & Legal" and "Human Resources" have a higher count of employees across locations.
- Lowest Locations: Departments like "Training" and "Research" seem to have fewer employees.

### 2. Location by Gender (Bar Chart - Top Middle)
This chart shows the gender distribution across three locations: Kaduna, Abuja, and Lagos.
#### Key Insights:
- Kaduna has the largest count of employees overall.
- Abuja and Lagos have smaller, relatively balanced gender representation.

### 3. Salary by Gender (Pie Chart - Top Right)
This pie chart displays the salary distribution between genders.
#### Key Insights:
- The gender breakdown shows:
  1. Male (47.54%)
  2. Female (52.17%)
- Females have a slightly higher share of the salary distribution.

### 4. Salary by Department (Line Chart - Top Far Right)
This chart shows how salaries vary across departments.
#### Key Insights:
- Departments like "Product & Legal" and "Human Resources" have the highest salary distributions.
- Departments like "Training" and "Accounting" have lower total salary contributions.

### 5. Salary by Rating (Bar Chart - Bottom Left)
This chart illustrates salary sums based on performance ratings.
#### Key Insights:
- Average ratings contribute to the highest salary sums.
- Ratings such as “Very Poor” and “Not Rated” contribute significantly lower salary sums.

### 6. Department by Rating (Horizontal Bar Chart - Bottom Middle)
This visual shows the count of ratings for different departments.
#### Key Insights:
- "Average" ratings dominate the chart with 420 counts, followed by "Good" ratings with 183 counts.
- Very few departments received "Very Poor" or "Not Rated" classifications.

### 7. Gender by Department (Vertical Bar Chart - Bottom Far Right)
This chart visualizes the count of genders across various departments.
#### Key Insights:
-	"Product & Legal" and "Human Resources" have the largest count of both genders.
-	Some departments like "Training" and "Research" have fewer gender-diverse employees.

### 8. Summary Statistics (Bottom Right)
This component summarizes the overall salary data:
####	1. Total Basic Salary: 69,723,670
####	2. Total Bonus: 2,195,513.40
####	3. Total Salary: 71,919,183.40
####	Key Insights:
  - The bonus forms a small but significant proportion of the total salary.

### General Observations:
- Locations like Kaduna and departments like "Product & Legal" dominate employee and salary distributions.
-	Females slightly outpace males in salary contribution.
-	Performance ratings highly influence salary sums.


## ANSWERS TO THE CASE STUDY 3 QUESTIONS

### 1. Gender Distribution in the Organization (Regions & Departments)
From your “Location by Gender” and “Gender by Department” charts:
-	Kaduna had the highest number of employees for both genders, followed by Lagos and Abuja.
-	Gender representation across departments was relatively balanced, but departments like Product and Legal had larger populations overall.
-	Employees with undisclosed gender have been grouped generically (as noted), ensuring a more inclusive and accurate analysis.
#### Takeaway: 
Despite the media criticism, Palmoria shows general gender balance.

### 2. Ratings Based on Gender
While the charts didn’t separate ratings explicitly by gender, we can infer relationships:
-	The “Department by Rating” chart shows that most employees were rated “Average”, which might hide individual performance differences by gender.
-	If gender is overlaid on ratings (not shown directly), this could reveal whether one gender consistently receives lower ratings.

### 3. Salary Structure and Gender Pay Gap
The “Salary by Gender” and “Salary by Department” visuals provide strong context:
-	Females received 52.17% of the total salary vs. 47.6% for males, indicating a positive trend toward pay equality overall.
-	However, without knowing the number of employees per gender, this may mask disparities. For example, if more women are in higher-paying departments or roles, the overall figure may seem equal, while individual gaps persist.

### 4. Compliance with the $90,000 Minimum Salary Regulation
This wasn’t visualized directly, but can be derived using the salary data:
•	You can filter current employees with a salary < $90,000.
•	A bar chart by region or department can be plotted to show non-compliance.
#### Suggestion: 
A compliance scorecard could track progress and identify departments or regions at risk of breaching regulations.

### 5. Pay Distribution Grouped by $10,000 Bands (and by Region)
This insight wasn’t in the current visuals, but would be best shown using:
-	Histogram to count employees in salary bands: $10K–$20K, $20K–$30K, etc.
-	A stacked bar chart by region (e.g. Kaduna, Lagos, Abuja) showing salary spread
This would help identify:
-	Salary clustering in certain regions
-	Regions with a higher concentration of low-paid or high-paid staff

### 6. Bonus Calculations Based on Performance Rating
From the KPI card:
- 1.	Total Bonus Pay: $2,177,976
- 2.	Total Salary: $69,723,670
Since bonuses are based on a rating-based rule table:
-	The following were calculated:
  1. Bonus = Salary × Rating-Based %, and
  2. Total Compensation = Salary + Bonus
-	To complete the request:
  1. Total bonuses and compensation per employee was calculated.
  2. Aggregate results per region for executive review was displayed on the dashboard.
